1. General
----------

This software package consists of two executables, client and server
that are the client and server for the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)

This two pieces of sofware are developed for the first assignment of the 
class Computer and Network Programming (CSC8415) at University of 
Southern Queensland.

Author of this project is Koray Kalmaz (kalmaz@gmail.com), it is available
for download from http://code.google.com/p/koray-tftp/

2. Installation
---------------

Step 1, unpack the archive:

tar -xzvf koray-tftp.tar.gz

Step 2, compile:

cd koray-tftp
make all

After make, executables are going to be created in the bin directory.

3. Examples
-----------

Please note that both client and server programs are far from complete, 
thus shall not be trusted in a production environment.

Example 1, :  Uploading a file with client to a server at IP: 10.1.1.10:

    $ ./client 10.1.1.10
    Host address given
    Host address given
    tftp> put file
    putting file
    tftp> TX loading for: 0.0.0.0:0
    I am a client:
    I will send WRQ
       Sending packet
    Received something
       Op code: 4; 4
          ACK : 0; 0
    Make packet:
       makePacket: size: 512
       pNo: 1
       OpCode: 3
       Sending packet
    .....
    TX; Exiting: 1

Example 2, :  Downloading a file with client to a server at IP: 10.1.1.10:

    $ ./client 10.1.1.10
    Host address given
    Host address given
    tftp> get oo   
    getting oo
    tftp> RX; loading for: 10.1.1.10:0
    State: Initialize
    I am a client:
    Dumping 12 bytes:
    0, 1, 6f, 6f, 0, 62, 69, 6e, 61, 72, 79, 0, Dumping c bytes:
    State: Connected
    State: Transfer (op->progress < 512)
    Session timeout: 1388
    Sending ACK: 0
    Sent Packet
    Listening for next data packet
    memmove ok
    State: Transfer2
    Make packet:
       makePacket: size: 0
       pNo: 1
       OpCode: 4
    Bytes to write: 200
    Sending ACK: 1
    Sent Packet
    Listening for next data packet
    memmove ok
    .....
    RX; Exiting: 1

Example 3, :  Send and Receive operations at server's console:

    ./server 
    Loading server thread
    Ready for new client
    tftpd> NEW; request from: 10.1.1.10:42062
    Thread created!
    Ready for new client
    TX loading for: 10.1.1.10:42062
       Op code: 4; 0
          ACK : 0; 0
    Make packet:
       makePacket: size: 512
       pNo: 1
       OpCode: 3
       Sending packet
    Received something
       Op code: 4; 4
          ACK : 1; 1
    Make packet:
       makePacket: size: 512
       pNo: 2
       OpCode: 3
       Sending packet
    Received something
       Op code: 4; 4
          ACK : 2; 2
    ....
    TX; Exiting: 1

    tftpd> 
    Loading server thread
    Ready for new client
    tftpd> NEW; request from: 10.1.1.10:48514
    Thread created!
    Ready for new client
    RX; loading for: 10.1.1.10:48514
    State: Initialize
    I am a SERVER
    State: Connected
    State: Transfer (op->progress < 512)
    Session timeout: 7000
    Sending ACK: 0
    Sent Packet
    Listening for next data packet
    memmove ok
    State: Transfer2
    Make packet:
       makePacket: size: 0
       pNo: 1
       OpCode: 4
    Bytes to write: 512
    Sending ACK: 1
    Sent Packet
    Listening for next data packet
    memmove ok
    Make packet:
       makePacket: size: 0
       pNo: 2
        .....
       OpCode: 4
    Bytes to write: 10
    State: Finished
    Sending ACK: 8
    Sent Packet
    Total: 3594
    RX; Exiting: 1

4. Documentation
----------------

1. binary for server will attempt to listen at port 69 by default. to 
override this, a custom port number can be given as parameter.

2. There are also several console commands for managing ongoing transfers.
entering "help" or "?" will print available commands.

3. host address can be passed to client as parameter.



5. Known problems
-----------------

Despite of multi client-server design, Both send and receive operations 
will fail after being unable to acquire listening socket. binaries must 
be restarted to overcome this problem.

Only bimary mode is implemented for this version of the software.
